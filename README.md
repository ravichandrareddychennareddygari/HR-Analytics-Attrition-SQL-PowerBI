HR Analytics Dashboard
ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project is an HR Analytics Dashboard built using Power BI. The main goal is to study employee attrition and provide insights that help HR teams take better decisions.

The dataset was first cleaned using SQL (removing duplicates, handling null values, and standardizing columns) and then imported into Power BI for visualization.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

Show important HR KPIs (Attrition Rate, Average Age, Income, Total Employees).

Analyze attrition patterns by department, job role, gender, and marital status.

Understand the effect of overtime and job satisfaction on attrition.

Provide time-based filtering with a timeline slicer.
